    <h2>A Creamy and Delicious Pasta</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic recipe. The sauce needs only two ingredients. Add pancetta or bacon to round out the dish. Garnish with pepper and some grated cheese. It's so simple!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese, 1 cup grated</li>
        <li>Bacon, 1 rasher</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the bacon and bring a pot of water to a boil for the pasta.</li>
        <li>Once the water is boiling, drop in the spaghetti. After the tips have softened, about 1 minute, stir the pasta to submerge all the spaghetti.</li>
        <li>Combine the eggs and grated cheese to form the sauce.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is cooked, about 9 minutes, transfer to a pan. You want to include a splash of the pasta water while transfering. I normally grab it with tongs and transfer it dripping wet rather than strain the pasta.</li>
        <li>Mix the pasta and sauce. Add the bacon.</li>
    </ol>
